# custom_yugioh_banlists_react

Sticking the YGO Banlist customs in a React Bootstrap environment

### To Dos

- Try adding the actual F/L listed cards in the mix
- Remove quotes from name entries like "Infernoble Arms - Durendal" (thats the only card thats like that so not a big deal)
- Start on Pauper Banlist

### Future Plans

- Add PDF download capability to snapshot tournament lists 
- Include method to commit card IDs to text file to include custom banlists for online simulators like EDO and Omega
