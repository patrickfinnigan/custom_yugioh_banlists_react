# YGOPRO Budget Banlist

pretty much this is a personal project to generate yugioh budget and pauper format banlists using the ygopro api

## to-dos

implement the pauper formatting method into the pauper list, by grabbing card rarity data and filtering out anything that is common (all unlimited) or rare (all limited to 1)
