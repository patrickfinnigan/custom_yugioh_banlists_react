# custom_yugioh_banlists_react

Sticking the YGO Banlist customs in a React Bootstrap environment

### To Dos

- Determine how to handle card entries that violate the cuurrent F/L threshholds (ex. cards that show up with a minPrice of more than $5 are still showing up on the Limited section of the list)

- Remove quotes from name entries like "Infernoble Arms - Durendal"

- Figure out why some API entries return with "0.00" in their set_price values, including the following:
  - Red Dragon Archfiend/Assault Mode
  - Dragonmaid Hospitality
  - Toon Bookmark
